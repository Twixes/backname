# Backname

Backname is a DNS server that gives every IP address its very own domain:

- **142.250.147.138.backname.io** resolves to **142.250.147.138**  
  _IPv4 with dots_
- **127-0-0-1.backname.io** resolves to **127.0.0.1**  
  _IPv4 with hyphens_
- **2a00.1450.401b.810.0.0.0.200e.backname.io** resolves to **2a00:1450:401b:810::200e**  
  _IPv6 with dots_
- **0--1.backname.io** resolves to **::1**  
  _IPv6 with hyphens_

The service is live publicly and for free over at [backname.io](https://backname.io), but feel free to host your own instance if you wish.

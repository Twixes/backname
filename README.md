# Backname

Backname is a DNS server that gives every IP address its very own domain.  
For example:

- **127.0.0.1.backname.io** resolves to **127.0.0.1**
- **142.250.147.138.backname.io** resolves to **142.250.147.138**
- **2001.0db8.85a3.0000.0000.8a2e.0370.7334.backname.io** resolves to **2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334**
- **2a00-1450-401b-810-0-0-0-200e.backname.io** resolves to **2a00:1450:401b:810::200e**

The service is live publicly and for free over at [backname.io](https://backname.io), but feel free to host your own instance if you wish.
